cl-libusb provides an easy interface to libusb-0.1. There are two
systems/packages: libusb-ffi, which provides a (somewhat lispified)
ffi to libusb-0.1, and cl-libusb, which provides an easier interface.

Buffers are dealt with using unsigned byte static vectors. 

libusb-ffi (and thus cl-libusb) is not complete, but should be usable.

Tested and found to work on:
linux amd64 (sbcl)
